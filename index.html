    <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center; gap: 20px;">
      <div style="flex: 1 1 60%; min-width: 250px;">
        <p>Hello! My name is Zainab Memon and I'm from Champaign, Illinois. I am a junior in Computer Engineering with a
          minor in Mathematics and am interested in specializing in cybersecurity. I enrolled in the Leadership
          Certificate Program in the spring of my sophomore year because I'm passionate about developing effective
          leadership skills to drive positive change in any situation. I believe in empowering teams and fostering
          environments where everyone can thrive, and I see leadership as the crucial catalyst for making that happen.
        </p>
        <p>For me, leadership isn't just about giving directions or being in charge. It's about inspiring a shared
          vision and empowering others to contribute their unique strengths. I've always been drawn to the idea of
          bringing people together, whether it's through collaborative projects or community initiatives. I've seen
          firsthand how a supportive leader can transform a group of individuals into a cohesive, high-performing team,
          capable of achieving far more than they could alone. This desire to uplift and enable others is what truly
          drives my interest in leadership. It's about building strong relationships, fostering an inclusive atmosphere,
          and ultimately, creating a ripple effect of positive impact.</p>

    <h2>Personal Development Plan</h2>
    <p>Guided by reflection and intention, my development plan outlines the leadership goals I set for myself as part of
      this program. It captures my values, growth priorities, and the strategies I’m using to become a more thoughtful
      and effective leader.</p>

    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Spring 2025 Semester:</strong> Leadership Development Course
        <p>The leadership course I took was ENG377: Pedagogy & Mentoring for ELAs (Engineering Learning Assistants),
          taught by Kimberely Powers. This course served as preparation for my Fall 2025 role leading a section of
          ENG100 for freshmen, where I will introduce them to Grainger College of Engineering and the ECE Department.
        </p>
        <p>Below is a sample of my coursework, in which I reflect on my top two CliftonStrengths and explore how to
          apply them in my ELA role. </p>
        <iframe src="assets/Sample of Work.pdf" width="100%" height="600px" style="border: none;"></iframe>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Spring 2025 Semester:</strong> Co-Curricular Team Experience
        <p>Through my role as Publicity Team Chair for the Electrical and Computer Engineering Student Advancement
          Committee, I’ve learned that leadership is not about directing every move but fostering collaboration and
          creating an environment where team members feel heard and empowered. I was responsible for overseeing tasks
          like designing posts for Instagram, advertising on the TVs in the ECE building, and working on the committee’s
          new website. These projects required careful coordination with other subcommittees and individual team members
          to ensure alignment with our goals and deadlines.</p>
        <p>I learned that leadership often involves balancing multiple perspectives, considering how to engage the
          broader ECE student body, and encouraging team members to bring their ideas forward. Rather than simply making
          decisions myself, I worked to guide the team toward solutions by facilitating discussions and providing
          support when needed.</p>
        <p>One of the most challenging aspects of my role was managing the creation of our new website, which involved
          shifting relevant content from the old website while ensuring that the new site aligned with the committee’s
          goals and vision. The transition presented several obstacles, including understanding the technical details of
          website design and managing the coordination of team members responsible for different sections. At the same
          time, there was pressure to ensure that the old content didn’t get lost, so I had to stay on top of every
          update and maintain a clear communication loop within the team.</p>
        <p>I navigated this challenge by staying organized and breaking the tasks into smaller, manageable steps. I
          created a project timeline and delegated specific content migration tasks to team members based on their
          strengths, while I focused on ensuring that the overall look and feel of the website aligned with our
          branding. By being clear in communication and flexible with deadlines, we were able to successfully launch the
          new site. This experience taught me that leadership requires patience and the ability to adapt when things
          don’t go as planned.</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>January 30, 2025:</strong> Clifton Strengths Workshop
        <p>The CliftonStrengths workshop gave me valuable insights into my natural talents and how I can leverage them
          in my academic, professional, and personal life. Learning that my top strengths are Harmony, Relator, Empathy,
          Deliberative, and Consistency helped me understand why I prioritize collaboration, deep connections, and
          thoughtful decision-making.</p>
        <p>One key takeaway was recognizing how my strengths shape my leadership style. Harmony and Relator make me
          adept at fostering inclusive environments, ensuring everyone feels heard and valued. Empathy enhances my
          ability to support others, while Deliberative and Consistency enable me to make careful, fair decisions. These
          qualities will be especially useful as I take on leadership roles, such as in the ECE Student Advancement
          Committee, Illinois Student Council, and beyond, where I’ll need to balance different perspectives and execute
          plans effectively.</p>
        <p>Moving forward, I will focus on refining these strengths to become a more intentional leader and team member.
          By embracing my natural tendencies while also pushing myself to take risks, I can create meaningful
          connections, foster collaboration, and ensure that my contributions have a lasting impact.</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>March 12, 2025:</strong> Leading with Empathy and Compassion Workshop
        <p>The workshop deepened my understanding of the nuances between pity, sympathy, empathy, and compassion. I
          learned that while pity and sympathy create distance, true empathy fosters connection by allowing us to
          understand and share another’s emotions. Compassion goes a step further, combining empathy with action. This
          distinction reinforced the importance of not just feeling for others but actively supporting them.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I learned that while active listening focuses on comprehension and response, empathetic
          listening prioritizes understanding emotions and validating experiences. This skill is crucial in leadership,
          as it builds trust and meaningful relationships. I will apply these insights in my leadership roles by
          practicing empathetic listening with my peers and taking proactive steps to support those in need by creating
          an environment where people feel heard and valued.</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>April 14, 2025:</strong> Leading With Integrity Leadership Lab
        <p>This program has been a meaningful experience that challenged me to think deeply about ethics, integrity, and
          the kind of leader I want to be. I appreciated the opportunity to reflect on real-life dilemmas and learn
          practical frameworks for making values-based decisions. Overall, it gave me tools and insights that I’ll carry
          forward in both personal and leadership settings.</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>April 16, 2025:</strong> Strengths Based Leadership Lab
        <p>My experience in the Strengths Based Leadership Lab was incredibly insightful and empowering. I learned how
          to identify and apply my unique strengths in team settings, which helped me better understand my leadership
          style and how to collaborate effectively with others. The interactive activities and reflections challenged me
          to grow both personally and professionally.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Summer 2025:</strong> Began developing this ePortfolio to reflect on and share my Leadership
        Certificate journey.
        <p>Creating this was an incredible opportunity to combine my technical skills with personal reflection. It
          allowed me to thoughtfully document my growth, synthesize key takeaways from the program, and present my
          leadership development in a way that feels both meaningful and authentic.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>September 21, 2025</strong> Creating a Culture of Feedback Workshop
        <p>The Creating a Culture of Feedback workshop made me think about how I give and receive feedback. In the past, 
          I’ve sometimes felt defensive when getting feedback or worried about how I might sound when giving it to others. 
          This workshop helped me see that feedback doesn’t have to be uncomfortable. It can actually build stronger 
          relationships if it’s given with empathy and received with openness. Practicing the feedback model gave me 
          tools I can use to make conversations feel less tense and more productive. Moving forward, I want to create 
          spaces where people feel safe sharing honest thoughts, whether that’s in group projects, leadership roles, or 
          future professional teams. I hope to approach feedback not as criticism, but as a chance to grow and support 
          others in their growth too.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>September 24, 2025</strong> Navigating Multicultural Organizations Workshop
        <p>The Navigating Multicultural Organizations workshop was an eye-opening experience because it pushed me to
           reflect on how my Pakistani background and American identity intertwine in ways I hadn’t always considered. 
           I realized that I don’t fully fit into either cultural “norm.” For example, I identify more with American 
           linear-time values, where being punctual and following strict schedules feels natural to me, rather than the 
           more flexible approach to time common in Pakistani culture. At the same time, I connect deeply with the high-context 
           communication style I grew up with in my Pakistani family, which contrasts with the low-context, direct style that 
           dominates American spaces. Recognizing these differences showed me that I carry unique strengths from both cultures. 
           Moving forward, I want to use this awareness to better navigate multicultural teams, valuing different perspectives 
           while also being conscious of the assumptions I bring to interactions.</p>

      <h4 id="self-management">Self-Management</h4>
      <p> Through the program, I developed stronger self-awareness and strategies for managing my time, energy,
        and emotions. I learned to set clear goals, prioritize tasks, and stay grounded under pressure.
        Reflection activities helped me identify patterns in my behavior and adjust my habits to align better
        with my values and responsibilities. I became more intentional about how I approach challenges and how
        I hold myself accountable. Building resilience, setting boundaries, and practicing mindfulness all
        contributed to my growth. I now feel more in control of my actions and better equipped to navigate
        stress, maintain focus, and lead with consistency and purpose. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fade-block">
      <h4 id="openness">Openness</h4>
      <p>I have become more open to feedback as a tool for growth rather than criticism. Instead of reacting
        defensively, I now listen to understand and reflect on how I can improve. Receiving feedback,
        especially the difficult kind, has helped me recognize blind spots, challenge assumptions, and
        strengthen my skills. I’ve learned to welcome different perspectives, ask clarifying questions,
        and apply insights constructively. This mindset shift has made me more adaptable, humble, and
        self-aware. By embracing feedback as a continuous learning opportunity, I have grown not only in
        confidence but also in my ability to lead with empathy and a willingness to evolve.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="fade-block">
      <h4 id="communication">Communication</h4>
      <p>The program helped me develop more intentional, clear, and empathetic communication habits.
        Whether participating in workshops or team discussions, I practiced articulating my ideas
        more concisely and listening actively to others. The focus on empathetic listening in particular
        improved how I respond to and validate different viewpoints. I also became more mindful of
        nonverbal communication and the importance of aligning words with intent. These experiences
        have strengthened my ability to build trust, resolve conflicts, and foster open dialogue in
        group settings. Overall, I have become more confident in my communication and better equipped
        to lead with clarity and connection.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="fade-block">
      <h4 id="group-dynamics">Group Dynamics</h4>
      <p>Participating in group-based workshops and leadership activities gave me insight into how effective group
        dynamics shape collaboration. I learned how to observe and respond to different team roles, mediate conflicting
        perspectives, and align team efforts toward shared goals. By fostering inclusive environments where all members
        felt valued, I improved my ability to facilitate collaboration and manage challenges with sensitivity and
        structure. These experiences taught me that strong group dynamics require trust, clear roles, and mutual
        accountability. I now approach team settings with the mindset of a facilitator, aiming to empower others while
        ensuring cohesion, productivity, and shared responsibility.</p>
      <p></p>
    </div>
    <div class="fade-block">
      <h3 id="overall-experience">Overall Experience</h3>
      <p>The Leadership Certificate experience has been a steady process of discovery. It pushed me to reflect, adapt,
        and grow. Early on, I expected to learn techniques or best practices. Instead, I found myself returning to the
        fundamentals: who I am, how I show up, and what kind of impact I want to have on others. The program became a
        space to question assumptions I held about leadership, including the idea that it is something you are granted
        through a title or role. I began to see leadership as something you cultivate day by day, moment by moment,
        through your presence, decisions, and relationships.</p>
      <p>One of the most meaningful parts of the experience was receiving feedback, both formally and informally.
        I realized how rarely we give each other honest, constructive insights. At first, I felt defensive. But
        over time, I grew to appreciate how feedback can be a gift, allowing me to try again and improve. It
        helped me notice habits I had not questioned and guided me toward better alignment between my intentions
        and impact. A challenge I faced was figuring out how to apply what I was learning in real time, especially
        when stakes felt high or uncertain. But even in moments of failure or conflict, I could feel the skills
        taking root. I started pausing before reacting, checking in with others, and staying open to dialogue.
        Small practices like active listening or naming assumptions began to shift the way I operated in group
        settings. I learned to value not just results, but relationships; not just outcomes, but how we get there.
      </p>
      <div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center; gap: 20px;">
        <div style="flex: 1 1 60%; min-width: 250px;">
          <p>Looking back, I think of this journey as assembling a puzzle. Each conversation, reflection, or challenge
            added a piece. Some pieces were uncomfortable, like confronting my fear of conflict or my tendency to
            over-function in teams, but they were necessary to understand the bigger picture. The puzzle remains a
            work in progress. Not because it’s unfinished in a frustrating way, but because leadership is something
            I will continue piecing together and growing throughout my life. This program helped me find the corner
            pieces: the core values, practices, and questions that will guide me no matter where I go. From here, I
            feel equipped to keep building with intention, humility, and a clearer sense of purpose.</p>
